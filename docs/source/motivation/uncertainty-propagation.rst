Uncertainty Propagation
=======================

uncertainty quantification, how does the uncertainty in input parameters propagate through the model

Prediction
----------

We want to have an image such as the one below following some simple model. The codes for these graphs are available in _static/codes.

.. image:: ../../_static/images/fig-illustration-density.png
  :width: 250

.. image:: ../../_static/images/fig-illustration-reliability.png

Forecasting
-----------

We want to have an image such as below produced from some simple model.
