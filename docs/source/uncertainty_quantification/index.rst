Uncertainty Quantification
==========================

Here we explain and document in detail, the methods we implement
in the econsa package to perform sensitivity analysis and 
uncertainty quantification. An insight into how the calculations are performed is not 
a prerequisite for using econsa. 
In most cases, the default settings works fine. We talk
about the Elementary Effects (EE) method, which is also known as
the Morris method, which is an inputs screening method that helps
us to determine the set of infuential and non-infuential inputs. 
(TF).
