Methods
=======

Here we explain and document in detail, the methods we implement in the ``econsa`` package to perform sensitivity analysis and uncertainty quantification. An insight into how the calculations are performed is not a prerequisite for using ``econsa``. In most cases, the default settings works fine. We talk
about the Elementary Effects (EE) method, which is also known as the Morris method, which is an inputs screening method that helps us to determine the set of influential and non-influential inputs. (TF).

  Here we want to distinguish between qualitative approaches such as Morris method and quantitative approaches such as our integration of Shapely values.
