  We want to get in the habit of adding short tutorials on how to use the functions that we add right away and rely on ``tespy``. @Mila, please integrate a couple of test function for uncertainty quantification (definitely this one https://www.sfu.ca/~ssurjano/ishigami.html) in the package, throw it up as a package on in our ``OpenSourceEconomics`` account and then use it as a dependency here. We just want to get the workflow going, no need to have ``tespy`` well documented or anything.
