    "We can rely on `chaospy`'s features to construct flexible multivariate distributions for input paramters using copulas. This allows us to sample from the **joint distribution** of input paramters as is required for uncertainty propagation. However, we now also want to be able to conduct a quantitative sensitivity analysis using, for example, Sobol indicies (**@timmens**) an Shapley values (**@lindamaok899**). This remains a straightforward task where the multivariate distribution is known to be Gaussian as analytical expressions exist ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_normal_distribution#Conditional_distributions)).\n",
